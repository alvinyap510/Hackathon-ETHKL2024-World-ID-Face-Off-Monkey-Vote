# Hackathon-ETHKL2024-World-ID-Face-Off-Monkey-Vote

## Problem Statement

The project was inspired by the controversy surrounding IGN's handling of the Game of the Year voting for Black Myth: Wukong. Due to political and ideological differences, many gaming media outlets were known to have a negative bias toward the game.

Initially, Wukong held a commanding lead with a 90% win rate from over 180,000 votes. However, within hours, an unusual spike in votes caused its win rate to plummet below 70%, dropping its rank to third place. Notably, other games' win rates remained unchanged, raising suspicions of vote manipulation. Given IGN's history of criticism towards Black Myth: Wukong, defending their actions became challenging.

Our solution addresses this issue by implementing World ID Verification to ensure fair and bot-free voting, thereby restoring trust and transparency in online polls.
